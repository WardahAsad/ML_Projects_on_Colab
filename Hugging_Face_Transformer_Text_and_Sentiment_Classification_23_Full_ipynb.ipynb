        "\n",
        "## 🎯 Objective\n",
        "In this assignment, you will build a **Text Classification** model using **Hugging Face**'s `transformers` library. Specifically, you will work with the **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)** dataset to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative sentiments.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 🧩 Assignment Tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ Q1. Install and Import Libraries\n",
        "- Install the necessary libraries for this assignment:\n",
        "  - **Hugging Face**'s `transformers`\n",
        "  - **PyTorch** for model training\n",
        "  - **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing and evaluation\n",
        "  - **Pandas** for data handling\n",
        "  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizations\n",
        "- Import the libraries that are required to perform the tasks mentioned below.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ Q2. Load the Dataset\n",
        "- The dataset will be similar to the **SST-2** sentiment analysis dataset, containing two columns:\n",
        "  - **Sentence**: A text review of a movie.\n",
        "  - **Label**: The sentiment of the review, where `0` represents a negative sentiment and `1` represents a positive sentiment.\n",
        "- Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ Q3. Preprocess the Data\n",
        "- Perform preprocessing steps such as:\n",
        "  - **Cleaning the text**: Remove unnecessary punctuation or special characters.\n",
        "  - **Tokenization**: Tokenize the text using a pre-trained tokenizer from Hugging Face.\n",
        "- Split the dataset into:\n",
        "  - **80% training data**\n",
        "  - **20% validation data**\n",
        "- Ensure the labels are in numerical format (e.g., 0 and 1 for sentiment).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ Q4. Load Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer\n",
        "- Load a pre-trained transformer model such as **BERT** (`bert-base-uncased`) or **DistilBERT** (`distilbert-base-uncased`).\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ Q5. Tokenize the Dataset\n",
        "- Use the tokenizer to encode the **Sentence** column into tokenized inputs that the model can understand.\n",
        "- Convert the tokenized data into tensors for training.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ Q6. Fine-Tune the Model\n",
        "- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the sentiment classification task using cross-entropy loss.\n",
        "- Set up the optimizer (e.g., AdamW) and learning rate scheduler.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ Q8. Visualize the Results\n",
        "- Plot the training and validation loss curves to visualize how the model’s loss decreased over time.\n",
        "- Plot a **confusion matrix** to evaluate how well the model is distinguishing between positive and negative reviews.\n",
